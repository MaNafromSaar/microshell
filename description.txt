Microshell Implementation Explanation
This code implements a simple shell that can execute commands, handle pipes (|), process command separators (;), and support the built-in cd command. Let me break down each component:

1. Error Handling Function

void prerr(char *str)

This function prints error messages to stderr (file descriptor 2), writing one character at a time until it reaches the null terminator.

2. Built-in CD Command

void cd(int argc, char **argv)

Verifies it has exactly one argument (the directory path)
Changes directory with chdir()
Handles and reports errors

3. Pipe Configuration

Is done within the runcmd function.
Takes the pipe file descriptors, a flag indicating if piping is needed, and which end to set
Uses dup2() to redirect standard input/output
Closes pipe file descriptors after setting up redirection

4. Command Execution

The intended behavior is:

Handle built-in cd command internally
For other commands:
Create pipe if needed
Fork a child process
In child: set up stdout redirection if piped, execute command
In parent: wait for child, set up stdin redirection for next command

5. Main Command Loop

This processes commands from the arguments:

Tracks the start position of each command
Advances until a semicolon, pipe, or end of arguments
Sets the pipe flag if appropriate
Null-terminates the command arguments list
Executes the command
